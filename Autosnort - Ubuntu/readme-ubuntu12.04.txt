Hello AS users, this is a readme specifically for the Ubuntu edition of autosnort.

This script was the templete for the BT5, Debian and CentOS editions, so practically everything in the readme applies directly to this script as well as the others and their additional readme files.

I'm adding this readme as a notice that this script WILL support Ubuntu 12.04 and 12.10 installations as has been updated to check for either os version. lsb_release -r did seem to act in a uniform manner on Ubuntu 12.10, so if the script says that it did not recognize the OS version from the version string check, you can opt to say yes to continue the installation.

As always, reachable via:
